CCTMT (Cryptocurrency transaction monitoring thingy)
====================================================

Copyright (c) 2015 Robin Leffmann

CCTMT is a JavaScript/WebSockets-based client-side thingy that shows real time tx and block events on various block chains. That is all.

Two things to keep in mind:

* The order in which transactions and blocks are relayed on the network is not indicative of what blocks the transactions will be included in.

* It's not possible to distinguish between principal and change outputs in a transaction; the intended amount in a transaction is in most cases much lower than the total output.
